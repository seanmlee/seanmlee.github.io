## About

I am a scientist broadly interested in animal behavior.

In January 2020, I earned my doctorate from George Washington University for my research on maternal behavior and offspring development in wild bonobos and chimpanzees, under the mentorship of <a href="https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/primate-behavioral-ecology">Dr. Carson Murray</a>. I am currently continuing this research as a postdoctoral scientist at George Washington University.

In June 2021, I will begin a postdoctoral fellowship on Rocky Mountain mule deer population dynamics, space use, and maternal strategies at Brigham Young University, under the mentorship of <a href="https://pws.byu.edu/wildlife-ecology">Dr. Brock McMillan</a>.

My long-term goal is to use my training in behavioral ecology and data science to solve problems in wildlife management and conservation.

## Skills & Experience

I have spent 40+ months conducting **fieldwork** in Central America and East and Central Africa. I am beyond excited to broaden my experience to include the US Intermountain West during my next postdoc.

My **statistical computing** skills include wrangling and tidying decades-long datasets, data visualization via the grammar of graphics, and frequentist regression guided by null hypothesis significance testing. I am currently focused on incorporating Bayesian inference and information-theoretic approaches into my toolkit.

I was **lead instructor** for two undergraduate courses in primate behavioral ecology. I also completed **laboratory** rotations in primate endocrinology (at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) and geometric morphometrics (at the American Museum of Natural History).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I regularly engaged in local face-to-face **science communication**. Now, I am gaining skills in **web development** to expand my capacity for virtual science communication.
