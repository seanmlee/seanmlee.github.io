## About

I am a scientist broadly interested in animal ecology.

In January 2020, I earned my doctorate from George Washington University for my research on maternal behavior and offspring development in wild bonobos and chimpanzees, advised by <a href="https://cashp.columbian.gwu.edu/primate-behavioral-ecology">Dr. Carson Murray</a>.

I am currently a research scientist with the <a href="https://dnr.wisconsin.gov/topic/research/wildliferesearch.html">Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources</a> working on white-tailed deer population modeling.

My goal is to use my training in behavioral ecology and data science to solve problems in wildlife management and conservation.

## Skills & Experience

I spent 40+ months conducting **fieldwork** in a variety of ecosystems.

My **statistical computing** skills include tidying large datasets, data visualization via the grammar of graphics, and frequentist regression guided by null hypothesis significance testing. I am also working to incorporate Bayesian population analysis into my toolkit.

I was **lead instructor** for two undergraduate courses at GWU and completed **laboratory** rotations in endocrinology (at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology) and geometric morphometrics (at the American Museum of Natural History).

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, I regularly engaged in local face-to-face **science communication**. Now, I am gaining skills in **web development** to expand my capacity for virtual science communication.
